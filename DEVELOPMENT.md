## Coding Documentation
I'm going to be honest, this is not really coding documentation, this is more just a record of decisions that I made during development that I wrote down to remember them.
#
- Datagen will be used for advancements, loot-tables, recipes & tags (where possible)
- A lot of Models will be done with Datagen, but obviously custom/advanced Models will remain as Json/Blender Files
- Translation will be done with lang files, not with Datagen
#
- No Raw Ores for anything that isn't vanilla (might change my mind on that or add a config for toggling later)
