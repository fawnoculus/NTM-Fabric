## Coding Documentation
I'm going to be honest, this is not really coding documentation, this is more just a record of decisions that I made during development that I wrote down so that I remember them.
#
- Datagen will be used for advancements, loot-tables, recipes & tags (where possible)
- A lot of Models will be done with Datagen, but obviously custom/advanced Models will remain as Json/Blender Files
- Translation will be done with lang files, not with Datagen
#
### Some Stuff will be changed to fit into modern Versions:
#### Textures:
- Industrial Copper -> Standard Minecraft Copper
- Ores -> Ores but with new Stone/Netherrack Texture
- Buckets of Fluid -> new Bucket Texture
#### Names:
(Maybe make the old names & textures advisable through a resource pack)
- Blast Furnace -> Alloying Furnace
- Industrial Grade Copper -> Copper
- Minecraft Grade Copper -> Red Copper
- Blast Furnace -> Alloying Furnace
- HE (HBM Energy) -> NTE (Nuclear Tech Energy)
#### Features:
- RF to HE / HE to RF Converter -> Energy Converter (all Energy types  + to & from HE in one Block)
