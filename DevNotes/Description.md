# NTM-Fabric
## About
NTM-Fabric (short for Nuclear Tech Mod Fabric) is a Recreation of [HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT) for modern Minecraft Versions made in fabric while the original is a forge Mod for 1.7.10.

NTM-Fabric is a Mod all about technology, atomic science and nuclear weapons. Features include, and are not limited to:
- A large tech tree, with progression spanning over many machines and different types of reactors
- Nuclear reactors such as the Chicago Pile, the infamous RBMK and fusion reactors (and more!)
- Nuclear bombs, missiles and artillery
- Turrets, traps and other defensive systems
- Processing machines for extracting ores, assembling parts and refining oil
- Abandoned structures and dungeons to explore
- Hazards such as radiation, flammable gasses and lung diseases

For a Better Experience I recommend Installing a Recipe Viewer like [JEI](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei), [REI](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei) or [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi).

## Installation
NTM-Fabric requires [Fabric-API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and only works on [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) & [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/).
