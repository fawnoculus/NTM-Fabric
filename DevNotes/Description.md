# NTM-Fabric
## About
NTM-Fabric (short for Nuclear Tech Mod Fabric) is a Recreation of [HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT) for modern Minecraft Versions made in fabric while the original is a forge Mod for 1.7.10.

NTM-Fabric is a Mod all about technology, atomic science and nuclear weapons. Features include, and are not limited to:
- A large tech tree, with progression spanning over many machines and different types of reactors
- Nuclear reactors such as the Chicago Pile, the infamous RBMK and fusion reactors (and more!)
- Nuclear bombs, missiles and artillery
- Turrets, traps and other defensive systems
- Processing machines for extracting ores, assembling parts and refining oil
- Abandoned structures and dungeons to explore
- Hazards such as radiation, flammable gasses and lung diseases

For a Better Experience I recommend Installing a Recipe Viewer like [JEI](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei), [REI](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei) or [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi).

3. Put the Jar File in your Mods Folder.

## Other Versions
I will (probably) not make a Forge or Neoforge Version of this Port, but instead of complaining about that, why don't you try making that port? the code is opensource after all..

The Original 1.7.10 Forge mod can be found [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/ntm)

for 1.12.2 Forge use one of these Mods:
- [NTM Reloaded](https://modrinth.com/mod/hbm-reloaded)
- [NTM Extended Edition](https://modrinth.com/mod/ntm-extended)

For a more up to date 1.12.2 version there is the [NTM Community Edition](https://codeberg.org/MrNorwood/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-CE)

For 1.18 Forge try [Martin's Remake](https://codeberg.org/MartinTheDragon/Nuclear-Tech-Mod-Remake)
